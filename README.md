Rock Paper Scissors Game
by @jessicamosouza

*The game is based on the rules of the original Rock Paper Scissors game.* 

First, we ask the user for input between **r, s, or p** (rock, scissors, and paper, respectively), then it is time for the computer to choose between them too. 
With the user and computer inputs, we compare them, and then we see who is the winner of the match.
